# Thinking Through The Future of Web Search

## 0.1 Please
I'm pushing these thoughts into the public sphere for two primary reasons:

(1) *To facilitate a discussion around web search in which I can learn from others.* I believe what I write here has solid merits but I also believe that we do our best work when we are challenged, encouraged, and refocused by others.

(2) *To create a community of individuals who are interested in the future of web search.* Particularly individuals who are interested in actively participating in this future.

Note that you needn't be part of the second for me to value your input on the first. I don't want to miss out on wisdom from those who have other commitments/priorities than this project.

## 0.2 Phoebe?
Saying "the next search engine", "the future of web search", etc. is a mouthful. Throughout these documents I'm going to refer to this theoretical search engine as "Phoebe" for brevity sake.

## 0.3 Essential Characteristics
1. Phoebe will be pervasively **open**:
    - **Open Source** - under a permissive license.
    - **Open Data** - non-PII (personally identifiable information) will be available to the public.
    - **Open Algorithms** - including all core algorithms - e.g. results ranking.
2. Phoebe will be **human augmented**:
    - While Phoebe will make use of the best methods of automated information retrieval it will augment these results with *active* human curation / collaboration.
3. Phoebe will be **privacy centric**:
    - Individuals should be able to search anonymously or to explicitly choose to participate in the collaborative aspects of the engine (and to move between one mode and the other at will).
    - Phoebe will be designed to minimize the collection of PII even when individuals choose to participate in the collaborative aspects of the engine.

## 0.4 The Other Essential Characteristic
Phoebe will facilitate financial and relational opportunities for its users with a special commitment to the overlooked and underrepresented.

This will occur through:
1. significant profit sharing with users who participate in human augmentation aspects of the engine
2. by allowing individuals to demonstrate expertise in specific knowledge areas without traditional credentials or experience.

## 0.5 More to Come
Much of what I've written here may raise more questions than it answers. I don't anticipate that 0.3.1 or 0.3.3 will raise many questions (feel free to prove me wrong) but I do expect 0.3.2 to raise questions. For example, "Human augmentation (collaborative search) has been tried in the past (and failed) - what will make Phoebe any different?"

Similarly, I expect 0.4 to raise some eyebrows. Questions such as: "How will Phoebe produce revenue?" "What percentage exactly will be committed profit sharing?" "How can Phoebe ensure this helps the underrepresented and overlooked?"

To keep this document relatively short I haven't touched on these as well as numerous other topics but look forward to doing so in the future. Please take a few minutes to share your thoughts, questions, and concerns!
