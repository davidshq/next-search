# Radically Open

## 4.1 Please
- Take a few moments to read the opening [README.md](README.md) file which provides a brief overview of this project.
- Interact with this and other articles I'll post here. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts, questions, and concerns.

**Discussion Link**: https://hachyderm.io/@davidshq/109881053596337824

## 4.2 Open Source
Being open source provides a number of advantages:
- **Transparency** - anyone can review the source code and verify that it is operating as promised.
- **Collaboration** - anyone can contribute to the project - code, design, documentation, etc.
- **Freedom** - anyone can fork the project and create their own version.

I want Phoebe to be held accountable by the world. If someone is dissatisfied with Phoebe they should be able to fork the code and build their own version. This encourages continuous innovation and improvement of Phoebe if I want it to succeed.

## 4.3 Open Data
Phoebe will make available all non-PII crawled data to the public. This allows others to not only create competitive engines with the source code but also to jump start their endeavor with a large amount of data.

> I admire [CommonCrawl](https://commoncrawl.org) which makes available bi-monthly dumps of their crawls of the web. I'd like for Phoebe to follow this model and perhaps collaborate with CommonCrawl if they'd have us.

### 4.4 Exportable Data
Phoebe will provide a dump of your data if/when desired.

> A long-term goal is to see an inter-search specification utilized that allows one to take their search data with them (if desired) when moving to another search engine.

## 4.5 Open Algorithms
The algorithms powering Phoebe will be made available to the public. This allows:

- Others to review and critique our algorithms to ensure they are non-discriminatory and fair.
- Others to build competitive engines and/or other products using our algorithms.
- Others to contribute to building the best possible algorithms.

## 4.6 Aspirations
The initial goal for this project is to deliver a human augmented experience that utilizes a trust network to ensure the results are relevant and trustworthy. I'm drawing this line to limit the scope of Phoebe and allow it to be delivered within a reasonable time frame.

That said, there are further aspirations for the project down the road. As noted in my article on [Privacy Centric](S03.%20Privacy%20Centric.md) one of those is to allow users to store their PII and curation data wherever they wish. For example:
- On your local machine[^local]
- On a server you control
- On a third party storage service (e.g., Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.)
- On a self-hosted solution

I am particularly interested in seeing how Phoebe could utilize Tim Berners-Lee, et al.'s [Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/) project which detaches data storage from applications and offers a higher level of interoperability between applications acting on shared data.


## 4.7 Footnotes
[^local]: Even if someone chose to keep their curation data off of Phoebe's servers they could still actively contribute to curation. That is, they might explicitly allow Phoebe to read and utilize the data in it's anonymized and aggregate form. This raises some significant technical hurtles but is something I'd like to explore in the future.
