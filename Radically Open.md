# Radically Open

## Open Source
Being open source provides a number of advantages:
- **Transparency** - anyone can review the source code and verify that it is operating as promised.
- **Collaboration** - anyone can contribute to the project - code, design, documentation, etc.
- **Freedom** - anyone can fork the project and create their own version.

I want Phoebe to be held accountable by the world. If someone is dissatisfied with Phoebe they should be able to fork the code and build their own version. This encourages continuous innovation and improvement of Phoebe if I want it to succeed.

## Open Data
Phoebe will make available all non-PII crawled data to the public. This allows others to not only create competitive engines with the source code but also to jump start their endeavor with a large amount of data.

> I admire [CommonCrawl](https://commoncrawl.org) which makes available bi-monthly dumps of their crawls of the web. I'd like for Phoebe to follow this model and perhaps collaborate with CommonCrawl if they'd have us.

## Open Algorithms
The algorithms powering Phoebe will be made available to the public. This allows:

- Others to review and critique our algorithms to ensure they are non-discriminatory and fair.
- Others to build competitive engines and/or other products using our algorithms.
- Others to contribute to building the best possible algorithms.
